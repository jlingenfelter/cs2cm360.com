  <h2>Using 3200 DPI in CS2</h2>
  <p>3200 DPI is the highest common DPI setting used by competitive CS2 players. While less popular than 800 or 400 DPI, it has a growing userbase among players who want the smoothest possible sensor tracking and a fast desktop cursor. Modern mouse sensors handle 3200 DPI exceptionally well, capturing an extremely high number of data points per inch.</p>
  <p>The key characteristic of 3200 DPI is that even low in-game sensitivities produce fast cm/360 values. The lowest standard sensitivity of <a href={getPageUrl(3200, 0.40)}>0.40 gives a cm/360 of just {formatCm360(0.4, 3200)} cm</a>, which is in the fast turn speed category. To reach the balanced zone you would need sensitivities well below 0.40, which requires using console commands for custom values.</p>
  <p>For this reason, 3200 DPI is best suited for players who are comfortable with lower cm/360 values and fast mouse speeds, or who use custom sub-0.40 sensitivities via the CS2 console. Players who prefer balanced or precision cm/360 values should consider <a href="/800-dpi/">800 DPI</a> or <a href="/400-dpi/">400 DPI</a>.</p>

  <h3>Typical 3200 DPI Sensitivities</h3>
  <p>Players at 3200 DPI with standard sensitivity values typically use <a href={getPageUrl(3200, 0.40)}>0.40</a> to <a href={getPageUrl(3200, 0.60)}>0.60</a> sensitivity, producing cm/360 values from {formatCm360(0.6, 3200)} to {formatCm360(0.4, 3200)} cm. These are all in the fast range, demanding excellent mouse control and refined muscle memory.</p>

  <h2>Who Should Use 3200 DPI</h2>
  <p>3200 DPI makes the most sense for players who run high DPI for productivity work, multi-monitor setups, or creative applications and do not want to switch DPI when launching CS2. It is also used by players who specifically prefer fast cm/360 settings and have developed their aim accordingly. Some mice have their native or optimal sensor DPI at 3200, and using the native DPI can provide the cleanest tracking signal.</p>
